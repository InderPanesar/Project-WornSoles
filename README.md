# Project-WornSoles
Creating a 2D game in Unity to explore different people's experiences and the consequences of these experiences.

May 2021 Update: Unity has announced that as of now experimental DOTS packages such as ECS are not compatible with Unity version 2021. If you want to use ECS and other experimental DOTS packages, you MUST use 2020.3 LTS

-- Still an ongoing project --
